- First find the left and right subtree depth
- Make a helper function to do this
- if len(left) - len(right) <= 1 then its a balanced subtree
- return if its balanced or not and the depth of the tree 
- Now after the whole helper function is done, we can simply return helper(root)[0] which will run the boolean
