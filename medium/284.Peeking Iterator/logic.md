- Peek returns the next of the iterator
- next returns the peek and then again move the peek to next
- hasNext returns if the peek is None or not
- In constructor take self.current as iterator.next if iterator.hasNext is true else None
- Now for peek return the old current
- for next method return current but before that update the new current same as constructor
- for hasNext we will just look if current is present or not if it is then true else false
