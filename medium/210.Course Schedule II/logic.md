- Build a adjacency list of crs and its prerequisites
- Take two sets visit, cycle 
- go through each course and call dfs 
- If at any time dfs returns False then return empty list 
- Once all the courses are visited return output
**dfs function**
- First check the termination cases
- If the course is in cycle then return False
- if it is in visited then return True
- otherwise we will go into prerequisites for each course before that we will add it into the cycle
- call dfs on prerequisites courses if anytime it returns false then return False
- Once all the dfs for prerequisites of the course is done remove the course from cycle
- add it to visit and append it to output
- then return True
