- First set result as float("inf")
- now set the left and right pointer 
- while left <= right, we first check if it is already sorted then result = min(result and left number) and break
- now if it is not sorted then first find the minimum.
- update the result to minimum of result and middle element
- Now check if middle element  >= left if it is that means minimum will be in our right subarray so  left = middle + 1
- else we search in left subarray right = middle - 1
- return result at end
