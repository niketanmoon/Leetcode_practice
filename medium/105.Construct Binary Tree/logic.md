- First check if there is no preorder or inorder then return None
- Now root node will be first node of the preorder
- Now mid = find the root node val in inorder and we know that left of it is the left subtree and right of it is the right subtree
- Now root.left = recursive call with preorder[1:mid+1] and inorder will be for left subtree from 0 to mid i.e inorder[:mid]
- For right subtree preorder[mid+1:] and inorder(mid+1:) we dont include mid in the inorder for any case since this is already the root for the recursive call
- Now just return the root node
