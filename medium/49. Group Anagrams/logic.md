- Simplest solution is to sort each string and check if any thing matches then group it but it takes O(m.nlogn)
- Create a hashmap of tuple with counts
- Create a count list [0,0,0,] upto 26
- Then for each string note the count
- Now update the hashmap with count list as key and strings as values
- return result.values()
