- Use bit manipulation for this.
- Convert each string to a state integer
- Now if string 1 state integer & string 2 state integer is 0 then we know there is no match
- So we take the product of the length of string and update the maxProduct
- return max Product at the end
- For finding state integer go through the loop and go through each character in the string
- and do `state[i] |= 1 << (ord(c)-ord("a"))`
