- Go through the intervals
- Check if new interval is to the left of the current interval 
- then add it to the res and then add remaining intervals to the result and return
- if its not then check if the new interval is to the right of the interval this means we can add the current interval to the res
- else the interval is overlapping so new interval is minimum of first value of current and new interval
- and second value is maximum of first value of current and new interval
- Once loop is done and we found new interval we can add it to the res by res.append(newInterval)
- return result
