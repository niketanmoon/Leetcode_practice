- First sort the array as this will help to get rid of the duplicate and also iterating
- loop through the array
- Now if index  > 0 and previous array value == current value then we just continue to get rid of the duplicate
- Now this is basically a two sum
- Initialize left and right for remaining array
- while left < right
- check if sum < 0 then shift left pointer
- if it is greater then decrease the right pointer
- if its equal then we found the values so add it to a list
- and then increase the left pointer and then check untill previous left element and current left element is different keep increasing the left pointer
