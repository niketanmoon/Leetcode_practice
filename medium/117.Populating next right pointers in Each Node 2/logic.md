- If not root(Tree empty) return None
- Now point current to root
- and while current is not null, first store the current in temp and shift the current and current next to next level
- Now if temp is not null then call the function on left node to link the left and then on the right to link the right
- Once this is done iterate through each node in the same level
- Another way make the current and currentNext to move to one node to the left 
- then while going to the right move the current next.next to that pointer
