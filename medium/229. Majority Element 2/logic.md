- **Boyer Moore Algorithm**
- there will always be maximum of two majority elements
- initialize two variables candidate1,candidate2 for hold the two most frequent candidates
- initialize two pointer count1 and count2
- for each element in the input
- if the element is same as candidate1, increase count1 do similar for candidate2
- if count == 0 then increment the count by 1
- else:decrement count 1 and count2 by 1
- Now go through the list again and see if the candidate1 == num then freq+= 1 same for freq2
- Now if freq1 > threshold (len(nums)//3) then add it to the output same for freq2
- return output
