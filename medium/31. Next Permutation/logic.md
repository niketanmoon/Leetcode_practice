- Suppose [1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Find pivot 
-  go from reverse array and find where nums[i-1] < nums[i] here it is index 2
- pivot = 2
- Now check which index needs to be swapped 
- First find the swap index which will be at 3
- For this we will go through the array again and check which number is greater than pivot - 1 number
- Here index 3 needs to be swapped with 1 because nums[pivot-1] = 3 < nums[swap] = 4
- After this array becomes [1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]
- Now sort the array from pivot
- [1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]
