- Take 3 pointers 
- First is previous which is initialized to dummy node which points to head
- Take the first node
- Now while there is first node
- Check if second node = firstnode.next value is same as first node val
- If it is then duplicate is true and we increment only second pointer such that it points to different value and it comes out of the while loop
- Now if duplicates is True then we point previous.next to second node and duplicates is reset
- Then reset first node = second node and then repeat again
- In any case when duplicates is false then we just increment previous to previous.next
- We have to return head which is dummy.next
