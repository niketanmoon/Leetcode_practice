- Make 2 choices either add to the list or dont add to the list 
- if index ever reaches len nums then we append the whole subset list to the result and return
- otherwise we do backtrack algo 
- first add the nums at the index to the list
- then make a recursive call with i+1
- then again pop the element and again make the recursive call with i+1
- call the function with start index as 0
- return result at the end
