- First define previous, first violation and second violation as none globally
- Now call the inorder function
- which first goes to the left then visit the node and then to the right node
- While visiting the node we check if prev is not none and prev val > current val which means we found violation
- First check if its a first violation or not if not one then its a first violation update one to be the first element of violation which in this case is prev
- if its not a first violation then we dont want to update one since this is the second violation second is current element or the second item
- Now if it is not a violation we know that prev is current and then we go for right node
- Once the recursive call is done we will get two nodes that are violation then we just swap them
