- For doing in place we have to take truth table
- If original is 0 and new is 0 then state is 0
- if original is 1 and new is 0 then state is 1
- if original is 0 and new is 1 then state is 2
- if original is 1 and new is 1 then state is 3
- Now again go through the board and change 1 to 0, 2 and 3 to 1
- You also have to count all neighbors to find which state to put in
