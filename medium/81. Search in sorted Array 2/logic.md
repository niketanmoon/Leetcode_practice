- We will apply binary search 
- if target == middle then return True
- if we are in the left portion i.e leftNumber < middle, then we search for target in left portion
- if it is there then we do right = middle - 1
- if it is not then we move to the right portion
- Similarly check if we are in the right portion leftNumber > middleNumber
- Now check similar conditions for target in right portion
- Else the leftNumber = middleNumber that is we found a duplicate so just increment the left pointer
- This is same as problem number 33 but we know there are no duplicate elements
- In this case we have to look for duplicate elements
