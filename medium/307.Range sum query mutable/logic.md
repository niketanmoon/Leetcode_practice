- Approach with a segment tree algo
- First consider all the elements inside array as nodes
- Now take sum of two nodes and put it as its parent node
- Same for other half as well
- Now we will also consider the indexes for these nodes
- Sum is the left index to right index storage
- For update, if we want to add the element at some index then we will update the index node
- As well as the nodes that were in the path
