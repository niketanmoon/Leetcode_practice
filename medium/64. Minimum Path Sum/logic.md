- First define the rows and cols
- Now define the matrix with infinity for rows+1 and cols+1
- Now substitute the last position as 0 in matrix
- Now go through the rows and cols of matrix but -1 in reverse order
- Now matrix[r][c] = grid[r][c] i.e cost at the current index  + min(matrix[r+1][c] i.e down, matrix[r][c+1] i.e. right)
- Return matrix[0][0]
