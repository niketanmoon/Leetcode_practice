- First take the current and nxt variables and assign it to root and root.left if root exists otherwise None
- Now while current and nxt exist we take the current.left.next to be current.right
- Now for traversing through the level we check if current.next is there then we will update current.right.next to current.next.left
- Now we will shift to the next pointer for traversing through the level
- Now check if not current then we will update the current as nxt and nxt as current.left
- At the last return root
