- First convert the values into a hashmap number as key and count as value
- Now go through the hashmap and check if the count is > 0
- if it is then add it to the permutation list and decrement its count
- Now make a recursive call to dfs
- Once every recursive call is made then reset the hashmap that is increment the count and pop from the permutation list
- at the end return res
