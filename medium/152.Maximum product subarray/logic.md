- First take result as max(nums)
- Now take two variables currentMax and currentMin=1
- loop through the list if it is 0 then reset
- if it is not 0 then we first calculate a = num * maxP and b = num * maxP
- then we update current max by max(a, b, num) same for min
- then we update result by the max of result and current max
- return result at the end
