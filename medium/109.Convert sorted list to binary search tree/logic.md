- First convert the linked list to an array
- You dont have to sort it as it is already sorted
- Now call the recursive function with left and right
- Now if left > right return None
- Else find the middle element and create a root with it
- Now the elements to the left will be left subtree and to the right will be right subtree
- call recursive function on left and right subtree 
- For left subtree right becomes mid-1 and for right subtree left becomes mid+1
- return root
