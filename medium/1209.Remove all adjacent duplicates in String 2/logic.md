- Take a stack [char, count]
- GO through the string and check if the string character is the stack top character if it is then increase the count 
- else initialise the character with the count as 1 in the stack i.e stack.append([c, 1])
- Now check if the character count matches k if it does then pop the character
- Now go through the stack and do res += char * count
- return res
