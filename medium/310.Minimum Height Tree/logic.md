- First create a graph
- Once the graph is created, find out the degree of the nodes
- For all the nodes that has degree 1, push it into the queue and apply BFS and graph cropping
- When there are <=2 nodes remaining that are nodes that will generate the minimum height tree
- As these nodes will be the root nodes
