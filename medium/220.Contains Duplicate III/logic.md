- Lets make a hashmap
- w = Increase t by 1 
- go through the nums and if we find any multiple of w that is num // w is key
- Now if key is in hashmap then we return true
- Now check the previous bucket and next bucket and also check if number - hashmap[key-1] < w  then return True in both cases
- Otherwise store the key with number
- Now check if index >= k elements if it is then we have to shift pointer to right i.e remove element from the hashmap
- bKey = nums[i-k] // w
- del hashmap[bKey]
- At the end after for loop we can return False
