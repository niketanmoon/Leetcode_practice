- We are going to first define the base cases
- If i is already in dictionary cache then return dp[i]
- If char == "0" then return 0
- Now we want to achieve dp[i] = dp[i+1] + dp[i+2]
- So first take result = dfs(i+1)
- Now for dfs(i+2) second char in string, we need to check the number should be less than 26
- then res += dfs(i+2)
- Now cache this result
- dp[i] = result
- return result
- When the string ends it will give us the different ways to decode
- At last call the dfs(0) and return it
