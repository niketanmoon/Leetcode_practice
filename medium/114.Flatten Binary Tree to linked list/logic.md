- First make a recursive function which checks if the root is empty then return None
- Now get the left most node using recursive call to root.left
- Also get the right most node using recursive call to root.right
- Now check if there is a left tree
- then first make the leftTail.right = root.right i.e the left tail to be attached to the beginning of the right subtree
- Then we want to make root.right to point to node.left and then we want to make the left node empty i.e root.left = None
- Once this is all done check which one will be the last node
- First its going to be right tail if not then left tail if not then root
