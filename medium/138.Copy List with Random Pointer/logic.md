- Take two passes first current=head and hashmap= {None: None}
- For the first pass go through the list and create a copy node and map it
- For the second pass go through the list and create copy.next and copy.random
- copy = hashmap[current]
- copy.next = hashmap[current.next]
- copy.random = hashmap[current.random]
- return hashmap[head]
