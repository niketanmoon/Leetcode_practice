- most water = area
- width = right index - left index
- h = height[i]
- area = width * h
- Let max_area = 0
- Now l = 0 and right = len(height ) - 1
- Calculate the area, and update max area according to max of max area or current area
- Continue till l < r
- Also after calculating the area increase the pointer which has minimum height 
- l = l + 1 or r = r - 1
