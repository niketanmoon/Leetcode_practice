- initialize slow and fast as head
- Now increment fast pointer by 2 and slow pointer by 1
- if slow == fast we know that there is a cycle so we break
- Now we again initialize fast to head
- and then check if slow == fast first if it is then we return fast
- if it is not then we increment now fast and slow by only 1 and break if slow == fast
- Then return fast
