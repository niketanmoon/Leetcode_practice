- First initialize the rows and cols and also cache as hashmap
- Now define a helper function
- if r, c is out of bounds i.e r>= rows or c >= cols then we just return 0
- Now we check (r, c) in cache or not if it is not in the cache
- then we first check down, right and diag and find the max square there
- Now we first make cache[(r,c)] = 0
- Now if current position element is "1"
- then we do 1+min(down, right, diag) this can be 0 or 1 in both cases it satisfies
- so we store this max square length to the cache
- now in both cases we return cache[r][c]
- At end we call the helper function and at end we take cache.values max and square it
