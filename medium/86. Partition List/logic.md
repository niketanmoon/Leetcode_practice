- take 2 dummy nodes left and right
- take two tail nodes ltail and rtail to keep track of the last node in left list and right list
- Now iterate through the list and if val < x then add it to the left list 
- ltail.next = head
- and update the ltail to point to last node - ltail = ltail.next
- else: add it to the right tail and increment the rtail
- Now after we iterate through the linked list we have to update left to beginning of right
- and right last node to null
- Once everything is done return left.next
