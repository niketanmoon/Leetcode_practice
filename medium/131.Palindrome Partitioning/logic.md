- Initialize result and part as an empty list
- Now go through a function which will call index 0 
- If i is out of bound or equal to len(s) then add part copy to result and then return
- Now go through range i to len(s) and check if the string in that range is a palindrome if it is then first add that palindrome string to the part and then call dfs on it
- After dfs is called pop that string from the part
- Write a normal palindrome function to check the string
- return result
