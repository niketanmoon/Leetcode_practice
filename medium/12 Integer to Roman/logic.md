- First add all the symbols with value in a list including the edge case like 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900 and write it in a order
- initialise res = ""
- Now go in reverse order in a list
- if only the quotient of the num // val is other than 0 we add the symbol to the string
- count of symbol is num // val_in_list
- now add it to the list
- Then update the num so if its 1500 then we just want now 500 after 1500 / 1000
- num = num % val
- This will create a roman string 
- return the string
