- s = "abcabcbba"
- Now take two  pointers a and b and set it to 0
- initialize a hashset
- Now iterate the bpointer on s
- see if the character at b is in the hashset
- if it is not then add it to the hashset and increment bpointer
- Now the max has changed to len hash_set or the max number
- if it is in the hashset, that means we found a duplicate character, then we just remove the first pointer character and slide our window by 1 
- so a + 1
- Now max value is returned
