- First option is to add it in hashset and return list of hashset
- Second logic is to take XOR of all the numbers
- say nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
- x = XOR(nums) -> 6
- Binary form of 6 is 110
- find the first set bit position and divide the array into 2 based on that bit position
- why?
- Becoz 6 is the result obtained after 3^5 -> if we can throw these numbers into different parts 
- then our smaller arrays looks like -> [find the number that will appear exactly once and 
- remaining elements appear twice]
- Based on 2nd bit position if we partition the array it looks like
- Array1 -> [1,1,5]
- Array2 -> [2,3,2]
- Apply XOR for each part -> TADA!!!! We got what we want
