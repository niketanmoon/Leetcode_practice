- The first approach is to apply bucket sort that we did in hindex
- Second approach is to apply binary search since the citations is already sorted
- Check if the element at middle  >= range of citation papers i.e len - middle
- if it is then total is max of total and range. Also decrement the right pointer to middle - 1
- else move the left pointer to middle + 1 i.e the right part
- At the end return total
