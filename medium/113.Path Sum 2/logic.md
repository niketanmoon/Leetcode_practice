- First call the dfs function
- check the base case if not node then return
- Now if node is present add to the list and add node.val to the current sum
- Now check if its the leaf node and target sum = current sum
- if it is then only add current list to the output 
- Suppose current[5] on first node then this one should be passed to both left and right subtree therefore we do copy
- else first call the left subtree with the list.copy() and keep the current unchanged
- then we call the right subtree with the list.copy
- After everything is done we just have to return output result
