- We have to apply merge sort on linked list
- First if head and head.next is Null that means it is empty or just one node so return just head
- Now left is head and right is at the middle we get the middle by getMid function
- Now save right.next first. Now right.next  = Null and right node is temp
- Now once we figure out left linked list and right linked list we have to sort them using recursive call to main function
- at last we merge the list 
**getMid**
- for this we will use slow and fast pointer
- let slow =head and fast = head.next
- now increment fast by 2 and slow by 1
- this way at end slow will be at middle
- return slow
**merge function**
- First we will see if the list1 and list2 is not null
- then check list1 value and list 2 value
- if list 1 is less then we do tail.next =list1 else tail.next=list2
- and increment list1 or list2 accordingly
- at each pass increment tail = tail.next
- Now if list1 still exist then do tail.next = list1
- same for list2
- return dummy.next at end
