- Go through each row and column and call the dfs function
- If its true then return True
- After searching through the whole grid if it comes out return False
- Create a dfs function such that first it looks at the length of the word if i == len(word) then return True
- Write all the invalid conditions if any invalid condition is true then return False
- This includes if rows and columns goes out of bound or if the same cell is visited(to keep track of this maintain a hash set) and if the character is not equal to cell character
- Else just add the visited cell to path in a tuple
- Then call on dfs on all four sides and store it in res
- Now reset the path with path.remove()
- return res which will tell if it is true or not.
