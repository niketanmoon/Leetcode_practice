- First look for unsurrounded "O" these are only located on edges
- Now if you found one then call helper function on that row, col
- The helper function will check if r and c are not in bound or the element at r,c is not "O" then just return
- Otherwise it will change the element to "T"
- Then call recursive function on up down left right
- To call the helper function we will first go through all the elements and check if the element is O and the row and col is boundary or not if it is then we call the helper function
- Change now all the remaining "O" to "X"
- Now change all the T's back to O
