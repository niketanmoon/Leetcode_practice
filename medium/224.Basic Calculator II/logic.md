- Let the previous number be 0 and previous symbol be "+"
- Now go through the string and calculate the previous number which is p*10+digit
- Now if c is an operator sign or index is at the last element
- We check the previous symbol 
- if it is "+" then we add the previousNumber to stack
- if it is "-" then we push -previousNumber to stack
- if it is "/" then we change the top element as top element/previousNumber
- same for "*"
- At the end we reset the previousNumber to 0 and previousSymbol to current Symbol
- At the end return the sum of the stack
