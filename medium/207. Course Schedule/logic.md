- First update the adjacency list with courses and its prerequisites
- Also maintain a visit set
- Now for each course call the dfs
- IN dfs first check if course is in visited then we return False
- if there are no prerequisites for course we return True
- Now we add the course to the visit and go through its prerequisites
- if calling dfs on these prerequisites returns False then we return False
- Once every pre is iterated through that course we remove it from the visited and map the course to be empty list
- At the end we return True
- Go through each course and call dfs on it if anytime it returns false then return False 
- return True at end
