- initialize a start pointer endpointer and current pointer as 0
- Now while endPointer < len(nums) go through the array such that start pointer character == end pointer character then increment end pointer. The idea is to place the end pointer such that it is not equal to the start pointer character
- Then take the length = endIdx - startIdx
- Then take minimum of 2 and length which is the allowed length
- then just update the current pointer accordingly
- Now once you updated the values in nums, point start index to end idx
- finally at end return current index
