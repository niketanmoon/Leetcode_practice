- Take a dummy node and point it to head to avoid the edge case of adding a node at the beginning
- Now initialize previous and next pointer as head and head.next
- While current is not null we check first if the list is already sorted, if it is then just increment prev and current and continue
- Now once we found the node that is not sorted we start out loop from the beginning
- temp = dummy
- Now check if the temp.next.val >current.val if it is not then we just move the temp pointer forward to get the position where current node can be inserted
- Now attach the previous next link to the next node of current
- Now attach current next link to temp.next
- temp.next = current and current = previous.next 
- This way you added a node in between
- return dummy.next
