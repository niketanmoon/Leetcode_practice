- This follows a dynammic programming bottom up approach
- First we will find what number of coins are needed for 0, 1, ...n
- To calculate we will create a dp array with lenght amount +1
- Now initialize dp[0] = 0
- Now go from 1 to amount +1 
- Again loop from coins and if a-c is greater than equal to 0 
- Now dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a-c])
- For amount 7, coin 4
- dp[7] = min(dp[7], 1+dp[7-4]= 1+ dp[3])
- At the end return -1 if it is infinity else return dp[-1]
