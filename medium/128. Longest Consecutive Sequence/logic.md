- Create a set of numbers with set(nums)
- Initialize a maxCount = 0
- go through the array and check if num to the left i.e num-1 present in set if it is not then we can start the sequence
- length = 0 now while num+length in numSet we will increment the length
- Once it comes out we will update the max value of count and length
- return the maxCount calculated
