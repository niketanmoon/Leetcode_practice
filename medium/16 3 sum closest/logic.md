- First sort the array
- Now take the sum of first three numbers and store it in res
- Now go through the loop till len - 2
- then describe the left as i + 1 and r as len - 1
- Now while l < r
- if current sum which is addition of numbers at i, l and r  - target  < res - target
- then we update res with current sum
- if current sum < target then we increment l else decrement r
