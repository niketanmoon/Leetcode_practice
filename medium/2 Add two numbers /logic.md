- First create a current and temp node
- Now iterate through both the linked lists if at least one of them is not empty or carry is not 0
- add the values
- val = val1 + val2 + carry
- now after addition there will be a carry
- carry = val // 10
- now the val should be changed to last digit
- val = val % 10
- Now we need to update the val of the node
- current_node.next = ListNode(val)
- Once this is updated we need to increment all the nodes
- return temp.next
