- Implement bucket sort 
- First make a bucket of len + 1
- Now go through each number in candidates and check if number >= len
- then increment counter at last index else increment the bucket number at that index by 1
- Now go in the reverse order in the bucket and do the running sum 
- if running sum > index then return index
- At the end return 0
