- If the needle is an empty string then return 0
- Now loop through the string such that len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1 which is the window slide
- Suppose haystack length is 5 and needle length is 2 then we want to loop till 4th index of haystack. this is achieved by 5 - 2 + 1
- Now check if haystack from that index to the len(needle) + index is equal to needle or not.
- if it is equal then return index else continue
- If nothing is found return -1
