- First go through the array 
- initialize a start number from where you will start your range
- Now to find the break point you check if the next element is current element + 1
- If it is then we continue
- else we know we found the breaking point we check if the start == nums[i]
- if it is then we add the number else we add the start -> nums[i] in string format
