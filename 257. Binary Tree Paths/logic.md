- First check if there is no root node then return
- Now make a call to helper function
- Add the node.val to the currentString
- Now check if its a leaf node. If its a leaf node then append currentString to path and return 
- If its not a leaf node, Make a recursive call to left with list and currentString + "->"
- Check same for right node
