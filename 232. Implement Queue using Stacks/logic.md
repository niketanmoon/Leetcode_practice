- Use two stacks s1 and s2
- While doing push first check if there is anything in s1 if there is then first push it on s2
- Now push the element on s1 and then push s2 elements on s2 
- This way the last element that went inside will be the last element in s1
- Pop peek and empty is now same as stack - pop() s1[-1] len(s1) == 0
