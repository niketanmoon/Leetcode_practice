- First deal with edge cases when subRoot is empty then return True but if root is empty then return False
- now check if both are same tree or not if it is then return True
- otherwise go to the left of root and check with subRoot
- similarly go with right and check with subRoot. If any one returns True then return True
- Same tree function first check if both nodes are empty then return True
- if both nodes are valid and both values are equal then we check with its left and its right 
- return true if both are True
- else just return False
