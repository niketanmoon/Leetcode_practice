- Take every two lists and merge it according to merge sort
- When we merge the list we will append it to the mergedList
- at end we will update lists = mergedList
- Now we will do this until len(lists) > 1, once lists length is 1 
- we break and return lists[0]
- for merging we use merge sort algo
- Initialize dummy as a node
- Then tail = dummy now go through each list
- while l1 and l2 is valid we check which one is small and link tail to that list and increment l1
- if l2 is small then we do the same for l2
- in both cases update tail = tail.next
- Now check if still l1 is valid or not and link nodes to tail
- similar for l2
- return dummy.next i.e the head
