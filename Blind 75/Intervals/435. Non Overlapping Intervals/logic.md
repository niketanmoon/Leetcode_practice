- First sort the intervals 
- Now make the prevEnd = interval[0][1]
- Now go through the intervals 
- and check if it is overlapping or not if start >= prevEnd
- this is not overlapping so we make the prevEnd to be the end 
- if it is overlapping then we increase the result by 1 and make prevEnd as minimum of end and prevEnd
