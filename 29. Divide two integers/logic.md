- First we will take absolute of both numbers
- Now we will check if dividend >= divisor
- Then we will minus divisor from dividend and then add it to the result then we again multiply the divisor by 2
- and increment the multiplier
- Now check if the number is negative then return negative 
- Also check for edge cases
