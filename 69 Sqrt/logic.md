- First consider a integer as a sorted array of digits
- Now take left = 1 and right = given integer
- Now go until left <= right
- Find the half of that integer and square it
- if the middle digit square is greater than given integer
- then we do right = middle - 1
- else left = middle + 1
- Logic is same as binary search, in this case we can consider to find the middle element of the numberP
