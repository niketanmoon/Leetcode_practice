- Go through the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
- Here take two pointer slow and fast and initialize it to head
- while fast node and its next node is not Null
- increment the slow pointer by 1 and fast pointer by 2
- Now if slow == fast then we can say that there is a cycle
- when the whole linked list is finished we can say that there is no cycle
